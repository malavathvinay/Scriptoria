🎬 Scriptoria
AI-Powered Film Pre-Production Assistant
Team Name: ThinkwithUs

🚀 Overview
Scriptoria is an AI-powered film pre-production web application that transforms a simple story idea into a complete, production-ready pre-production package within minutes.

Using IBM Granite (via Ollama), Groq LLM APIs, Google Gemini, and Hugging Face image generation, Scriptoria automates five major filmmaking deliverables:

🎥 Formatted Screenplay
👤 Character Profiles
🎵 Sound Design Plan
📋 Scene-by-Scene Script Breakdown
🎬 Professional Shot List
🖼 AI-Generated Shot Visuals (via Hugging Face)
Scriptoria reduces weeks of manual pre-production planning into an instant AI-driven workflow.

🎯 Problem Statement
Independent filmmakers, student creators, and YouTube series developers often skip structured pre-production due to:

High outsourcing costs (₹50,000 – ₹2,00,000)
Limited access to professional screenwriters and cinematographers
Time constraints
Lack of production planning tools
Skipping pre-production leads to poorly planned shoots, budget overruns, and production delays.

💡 Our Solution
Scriptoria automates five interconnected pre-production deliverables from a single story input using specialized AI prompts and multi-model orchestration.
